# üß¨ **Vigil √ó Cofactor ‚Äî Verifiable Computational Science**

**Vigil** turns every computation into a cryptographically signed receipt.
**Cofactor** transforms those receipts into a shared research network where results carry permanent, verifiable provenance.
Together, they make computational work **reproducible, auditable, and effortlessly shareable** ‚Äî the way GitHub did for code, Hugging Face did for models, and Benchling did for biology.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Reproducibility Fails

Most computational results collapse under basic provenance checks.
Environments drift, datasets mutate, and ‚Äúsupplementary code‚Äù is rarely runnable months later.

```mermaid

  Root[Reproducibility Breaks] --> A[Ephemeral Environments]
  Root --> B[Hidden Lineage]
  Root --> C[Opaque Results]
  Root --> D[Fragile Workflows]

  A --> A1[Dependencies Drift]
  A --> A2[Containers Expire]
  B --> B1[Datasets Mutate]
  B --> B2[Pipeline History Missing]
  C --> C1[No Cryptographic Proof]
  C --> C2[Artifacts Untracked]
  D --> D1[Manual Re-runs]
  D --> D2[Non-deterministic Outputs]
```

The result: science without signatures ‚Äî valuable but unverifiable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Vigil in 60 Seconds

Vigil treats **schemas as contracts** and **receipts as evidence**.
Every run captures exactly *who*, *what*, *where*, and *how* a computation occurred.

Core CLI loop:

```
vigil run       ‚Üí capture command, inputs, outputs, env
vigil promote   ‚Üí canonicalize JSON + sign (Ed25519)
vigil verify    ‚Üí deterministic re-validation
vigil push      ‚Üí upload to Cofactor
vigil pull      ‚Üí re-hydrate anywhere
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Run[vigil run] --> Promote[vigil promote] --> Verify[vigil verify] --> Push[vigil push] --> Pull[vigil pull]
  Pull -. reuse inputs .-> Run
```

Receipts are portable JSON proofs ‚Äî lightweight enough for GitHub, durable enough for archives.
They survive toolchains, can be re-verified decades later, and slot neatly into pipelines built with Cursor or Next.js-style automation.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cofactor ‚Äî The Research Network

Cofactor operationalizes Vigil‚Äôs receipts into a **GitHub-grade platform for scientific computation**.

* A shared workspace to **browse, compare, and verify** computational results.
* **APIs + SDKs** for automating provenance capture and validation.
* **Versioned storage** that keeps artifact hashes and metadata in sync.
* **Team collaboration** with reviews, permissions, and AI-assisted summaries (√† la Cursor).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Researcher[[Researcher]] --> CLI[Vigil CLI]
  CLI --> Cofactor[Cofactor API]
  Cofactor --> Workspace[Shared Workspace & UI]
  Workspace --> Review[Collaboration & Verification]

```

Think *Hugging Face √ó Benchling* for science:
models, data, and experiments all tied to verifiable receipts.

## üß© Architecture at a Glance

A fully schema-driven stack ‚Äî like **Next.js** generating routes from code, Vigil generates APIs and SDKs from canonical schemas.

  App --> Storage[Storage Layer ‚Äî Postgres + S3]
  Storage --> Proof[Proof Layer ‚Äî Schemas + Receipts]
  Proof --> Compute[Compute Layer ‚Äî Kubernetes / Slurm / Local Core]
```

* **Schemas ‚Üí** JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 define Projects, Runs, Artifacts, Receipts.
* **API ‚Üí** Fastify + Prisma exposes those objects through an OpenAPI 3.1 contract.
* **Clients ‚Üí** Python + TypeScript SDKs (generated) keep CLI and UI in lockstep.
* **Cofactor App ‚Üí** Next.js 15 frontend renders the proof graph like GitHub renders commits.

| Stage         | Tool           | Action                              |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Run**       | `vigil-core`   | Capture code, data, env             |
| **Promote**   | `vigil-core`   | Canonicalize + sign (JCS + Ed25519) |
| **Verify**    | `vigil-core`   | Re-hash and validate schema         |
| **Push**      | `vigil-client` | Upload via OpenAPI                  |
| **Persist**   | `Cofactor API` | Validate ‚Üí store in Postgres/S3     |
| **View**      | `Cofactor App` | Explore proofs, lineage, metrics    |
| **Reproduce** | `vigil-client` | Pull receipts ‚Üí re-execute locally  |

## üõ°Ô∏è Integrity Guarantees

* **Canonical JSON (JCS):** deterministic bytes before hashing.
* **SHA-256 digests:** immutable identifiers for artifacts and receipts.
* **Ed25519 signatures:** tamper-evident authorship and proof.
* **Schema validation:** prevents structural drift.
* **Transparency hooks:** optional Merkle anchoring for third-party attestations.
* **Local audit log:** `.vigil/audit.log` captures every action.

The same rigor that Git brings to commits, applied to computational evidence.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

* Institution-level **policy engine** for reproducibility enforcement.
* **Graph provenance** + interactive DAG visualizations.
* **Chunked artifact** support for multi-terabyte datasets.
* **Multi-language SDKs:** TypeScript, Go, Rust.
* **Collaborative notebooks** running on Cofactor Cloud.
* **AI assistants** (Cursor-style) for receipt introspection and proof generation.

## üß™ Try the Loop

```bash
vigil run python train_model.py
vigil promote
vigil push
vigil pull
vigil verify

Re-run anywhere. Verify anytime.
**Vigil √ó Cofactor** makes computation as verifiable as commits ‚Äî
a *GitHub for scientific truth* and a *Hugging Face for reproducible models.*
